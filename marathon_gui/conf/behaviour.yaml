                This complete boat was made from a single oak tree truck, and still bears axe marks from its manufacture. 
                It was deliberately sunk as an offering and may have been specially made for this purpose.

                Between 1969 and 1972, Professor Alan Straw and Chris Alabaster (a schoolboy) discovered three hand axes, flint tools and animal bones in a quarry face at Welton-le-Wold. 
                It was soon realised that these finds were important not just for their extreme age, but for their context within the quarry face.

                 It is not clear to what extent Christianity was adopted by the masses, especially in the far-flung outreaches of the Empire such as Lincolnshire.
                 This lead tank is evidence of the existence of Christianity in late Roman Lincolnshire.

                The armour was found close to the battlefield, and it appears as if it was torn off in a hurry. 
                Perhaps it was cast aside by a fleeing Royalist soldier?
                The broadsword was found in the River Trent at Gainsborough.
